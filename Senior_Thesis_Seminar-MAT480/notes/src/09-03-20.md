## In-Class Notes

- next meeting will be at 3:35pm
- we will learn stuff and he hopes it will be interesting

### Internship Topics

- we could develop a database and make that more or less difficult, depending
on what is needed
- converting software used to deal with binary files -- including atmospheric
and meteorological data -- will deal with big data -- also include analysis of
data
- huge amounts of data that were amassed over decades and now should be made
useful
- it might be an online internship -- that would be nice
