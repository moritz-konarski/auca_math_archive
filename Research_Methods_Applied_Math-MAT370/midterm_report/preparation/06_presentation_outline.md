## What is the $3x+1$ Problem?

###

- based on the Collatz function $C(x)$
- often written in literature as the $3x+1$ function $T(x)$

### 

- number theoretic function -- deals only with integers
- map of positive natural numbers to the same
- stopping time
- total stopping time
- trajectory of a number

### Stopping time

### Total Stopping time

### Trajectory

- show the graph of a cool one?

## What is the collatz conjecture?

### Possible behavior

- integer function, so three possible paths

### The Conjecture

- for each natural number the collatz sequence contains one
- alternative ways to phrase that observation
- many unproven subsidiary conjectures

### research areas

- Lagarias describes applications in these fields

## What is cool about it?

###

- Paul Erdos quote

### 

- the problem itself is not that important does not have immediate applications
- general type of functions is pretty popular right now
- is seen as difficult because it is so random where maths generally needs
order to prove things
- it is simple to state and hard to prove which is cool
- ...

## History of the Conjecture

### background

- many different names based on people who studied it
- started with Collatz etc
- how research developed 
- today we have over 10^20 numbers verified

## Attributes of the function

### Cycles

- non-trivial cycle at {1}
- if we expand to all integers we get three more cycles
- Ch had a cycle of at least 272 mil in length, Lagarias say 10 billion
- Garner proved at least 10s of thousands

### Stochastic approximations

- show the pseudo-randomness with the help of a graph
- interesting because stochastic models are used to approach deterministic
systems
- we assume that the number of add iterated and even iterates is about the same
- because it seems random people are using probability distributions to
describe groups of these functions

### Height of the Graph

- height can be called the cardinality of the trajectory?
- how many approximation of the height of a function
- graph actual height of the function vs the approximation?

### Stopping time

- most ints have large stopping times, even though they can be very large
- average stopping time for odd integers should be around 9.477955
- general total stopping time estimation
- total stopping time is equal to the number of even iterates in the sequence
- upper bound for the total stopping time is 41.... log n -- suggests that all
sequences are finite
- graph the stopping times for some functions vs their approximations?

### 

- logarithmically the slope of the function is equal x
- most trajectories follow that shape
- some are split and more interesting
- iterates can be arbitrarily larger than the starting values
- sum of even ints equals the sum of odd ints plus the number of odd ints?
