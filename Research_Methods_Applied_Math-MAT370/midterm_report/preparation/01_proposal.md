# Topic Proposal: The $3n+1$ Problem

Moritz Konarski, 13.02.2020          

## Introduction

The $3n+1$ problem (also known as the Collatz conjecture) is defined as 
$$s(n) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        n/2  \quad &\text{if \emph{n} is even,} \\
        3n+1 \quad &\text{if \emph{n} is odd.}
    \end{array}
\right.
$$
A _Collatz sequence_ is the sequence of numbers produced by the repeated
application of this function starting at $n$. For example the Collatz sequence
for $n=20$ is $\{20,10,5,16,8,4,2,1,4,2,1,\dots\}$. Starting at any positive 
integer, it is conjectured that all Collatz sequences end in the cycle 
$4,2,1,4,2,1,\dots$. This behavior has been computationally verified for a 
very large amount of numbers, but a proof has not been found.

## Outline

I want to inform about the Collatz conjecture and explore the current state of
research regarding it or why it seems so difficult to prove. I need to do more
research to really focus the report on a specific thing.

Introduction

- What implications does it have for other areas of mathematics?
- Does it have practical applications?
- How could this conjecture be proven?

Conclusion

- Could the conjecture be proven soon?
- What would a proof mean?
