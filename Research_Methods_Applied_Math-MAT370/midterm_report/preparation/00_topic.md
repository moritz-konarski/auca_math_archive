# Possible Topics for the Report

- [Collatz Conjecture][collatz], [recent breakthrough by Terence
Tao][tao-collatz], $3n+1$ or $\frac{n}{2}$
- [Goldbach Conjecture][goldbach], any real number >2 can be written as the sum
of primes
- [Twin Prime Conjecture][twin-prime], there are infinitely many primes 2 apart
- [Riemann Hypothesis][riemann], Riemann zeta function for complex numbers,
where the non-trivial zeroes are
- large cardinals -- large infinities
