# Presentation notes

- Collatz Conjecture, Syracuse Problem, Hasse's Algorithm, Kakutani's Problem,
Ulam's Problem
- function
    - _Collatz function $C(x)$_ 
    - $3x+1$ function
- what is the conjecture
    - that natural numbers will eventually reach 1 or the one cycle
    - number theory -- study of integers and integer valued functions
    - the mathematical way
    - is there a divergent trajectory?
    - negative numbers give you three different cycles: $-1$, $-5$, $-17$
    - are there other cycles?
- what other things we can define about the function
    - forward orbits
    - height $h(m)$
- has been verified up to $17 \times 2^{58} > 4.899 \times 10^{18}$, all go to
1
- history:
    - first published about in Klamkin 1963
    - Collatz said he started thinking about this in the 1930s, informally in 
    a lecture by him in 1950 at the International Math. Congress in Cambridge 
    Mass.
    - really took off with journals starting in 1970
    - continues on to this day
- examples of some sequences
    - a couple easy ones for the board
    - some to put into the presentation
- see how easy this is? But now prove it
    - several incomplete proofs
    - Yamada 1981 -- mathematically faulty
    - Cadogan 2006 -- incorrect indices in a function
    - Bruckman 2008 -- would prove that the starting cycle at 1 does not exist
- what is interesting about it?
    - super simple yet not solved
    - maybe new areas of mathematics will be needed to prove this and thus
    advance mathematics as a whole
    - prime factorization and how it changes if you add 1
- one person wrote that it might be unverifiable
