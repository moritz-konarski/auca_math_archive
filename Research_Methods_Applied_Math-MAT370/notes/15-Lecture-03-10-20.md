- today we will hear presentations on the chosen topics

_Bayesian Inference_ -- Akylbek Sultanov

- named after Thomas Bayes who wrote a book about it
- updates a probability when more information becomes available
- example: is the long haired person male of female? most men have short hair,
so the best guess is woman -- too much explanation of the example
- $P(A) * P(B) = P(A) * P(A|B)$
- Bayes' Theorem: $P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)$
- incorrect probabilities -- what a moron
- What does statistical inference mean?
 
_Mathematical Modeling_ -- Adaid Iskenderova

- modeling is a representation of a real world problem in math. form
- generally parts of theory and experiments
- very popular in different areas of science
- process of modeling -- the different stages
- modeling is a process or a cycle that is repeated until the model is as
accurate as it needs to be for whatever task it is needed for 
- Predator-Prey-Model -- Lotka-Volterra-Model, an oscillation between different
population sizes
- building the actual model from basic equations
- this model results in a cycle of increase and decrease of predator and prey
numbers
