## Notes

- neuro-linguistic programming: _NLP_ is a discredited pseudo-scientific pile
of crap
- SCOPUS is a abstract and citation database by Elsevier
- Web of Science is something similar
- then there is the impact factor as a measure of how important journals are
- impact factor: the higher the impact factor, the higher the "level" of the
journal 
- kinda $\approx$ (number of citations in other journals) divided by (number 
of papers in the journal)
- Scopus is the most important database, Web of Science is in second place
- read the paper and look at it
- find what is unacceptable in the paper
- Chicago Style provides citations in footnotes on the same page as the source
is mentioned
