Short Presentation by Aidai

- what is mathematical modeling
- it is something that we use often
- understanding it better would be cool

Short Presentation by Saadat

- dark matter and dark energy
- current discovery of parts of dark matter
- it's hard to "catch" them so this is cool
- it could help answer questions about the nature of the universe
- dark matter was created after the big bang 
- dark matter attracts, dark energy repulses -- one of the reasons that the
universe is expanding
- _dark energy is faster than light?_ -- I feel like this is a weird way to
state it
- dark matter consumes light? 
- has a very strong gravitational force

Notes

- people cannot concentrate for 75 minutes
- thus it makes sense to split something like that into 10 sections of about
7 minutes each

To improve my presentation

- add some examples for various things
- for example, show one graph of an orbit and then use the graph to visually
explain the different elements that we can measure and graph them as well
- this would make it a lot more understandable
- more voice modulation
- no chewing gum
- use some bold type face to highlight stuff
- explain it in the most simple terms
- give examples for each of the types
- transfer the presentation to proper latex
