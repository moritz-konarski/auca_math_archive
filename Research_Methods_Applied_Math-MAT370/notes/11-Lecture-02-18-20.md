#### Abstract 

Application of Additional Argument Method to Burgers type equation with an 
integral term on the right-hand side was considered. A scheme of the method 
for the Burgers type equation is constructed. The validness of the scheme 
construction using Computer Algebra System (CAS) Maple was proved. The 
capability of modern CAS to prove mathematical theorems was demonstrated. The 
graphical solution of the series sample equations was constructed.

#### Introduction

A new method for studying partial differential equations, later called ”the 
Additional Argument Method”(AAM) was developed in the works [1]– [5]. 
This method allows to reducing partial differential equation to the 
system of integral equations, which is much easier to analyze in 
terms of the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Naturally, the idea 
of application of the Method to investigate the classic problems 
appeared. One of them is the Burgers equation which is the particular 
one-dimensional case of the Navier-Stokes equation. Besides the applications 
to hydrodynamics, Burgers equation has applications to wide variety of 
knowledge fields. For example, the Burgers equation is used in macroeconomics 
to model development of the ”World Economy” system [6].          

t is the time interval of consideration,KS is the self-organization 
coefficient, the structural characteristics, the parameter, which describes 
the economical usefulness, the effectiveness of political system structure and 
characterizes dissipation minimization and capability to optimize resource 
distribution for industry and benefits for consumption.       

l=Y is the production of goods in the time interval t is the output speed or 
economic growth in the time interval;
is economic growth rates;LQ=LKN is skilled labor or population of the country 
taking into account labor qualification where : L is population;L is population 
growth rate;L is population growth rate; N is population with higher education;
KN is coefficient of qualification of work of public system, 
characteristics of the growth of structural information, expressed by created 
new knowledge. Creating new knowledge is the intellectual labour of the 
population with higher education, expressed by the growth of the population 
with higher education N.          

Another example of Burgers equation application is the 
single-band transport stream modelling. This macroscopic (hydrodynamic) 
model was developed by Witham G. ( [7],1974). In contrast to the previously 
proposed models, based on the law of conservation of the number of vehicles, 
the ”farsightedness” of driver s was taken into account [10]. where Q(p) =
pv(p);p(t,x) is the amount of transport per unit length at time t in the 
neighborhood of a route point x;v(t,x) is velocity at time t in the neighborhood 
of a route point. The left-hand side of equation (1) represents the 
conservation law of trans-port. The diffusion terms appearing in the 
right-hand side of equation correspond to the fact that drivers reduce speed 
with increasing traffic density ahead and increase speed when decreasing.      

In 
the work [2] the scheme of the additional argument method is implemented for 
the various classes of equations. In this paper the solution of the 
particular equation was verified. The solving of this problem is 
quite complicated and time-consuming. Therefore the decision to use 
of the CAS Maple to facilitate verification of the correctness of the 
solution was taken. In the following part of the paper the theoretical 
bases of Additional Argument Method is given. The detailed prove of 
the theorem using Maple is provided. The test example with the known 
analytical solution was compared to the solution obtained by AAM. Then the 
solution of the problem with integral term on the right hand side is provided. 
This theoretical analysis is followed by sample equation with the numerical 
solution and it’s graph.

#### Abstract

This paper considers an application of the Additional Argument Method to the
Burgers' equation with an integral term on the right-hand side. The scheme of 
this method for Burgers' equation is constructed and its validity proven using 
the Computer Algebra System Maple. The proof demonstrates the capability of 
these systems to prove mathematical theorems. Furthermore, the graphical 
solution of the series sample equations is constructed.

#### Introduction

The _Additional Argument Method_ (AAM) is a new method for studying partial
differential equations which was developed in the works [1]–[5]. 
The AAM allows partial differential equations to be reduced to a
system of integral equations whose existence and uniqueness of the solutions
is easier to analyze. Accordingly, applying this method to classic problems 
is of interest. One such classic problem is the Burgers equation, the 
particular one-dimensional case of the Navier-Stokes equation. Besides its
applications to hydrodynamics, the Burgers equation is used in macroeconomics 
to develop the "World Economy" system [6] and to model single-band transport 
streams [7].       

The scheme of the AAM is implemented in [2] for various classes of equations. 
This paper verifies the particular equation using the Computer Algebra System 
Maple because the solving of this problem is quite complicated and 
time-consuming. First, the theoretical bases of the AAM is given and a detailed 
proof of the theorem using Maple is provided. An example with a known 
analytical solution is compared to the solution obtained through AAM. Then, 
the solution of the problem with an integral term on the right-hand side is 
provided. Finally, a sample equation with the numerical solution and it’s 
graph is shown.

## Notes

### Plagiarism

- _definition:_ Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work or ideas as your
own ,with or without their consent, by incorporating in into your work without
full acknowledgement
- only two ways: solving old problem with a new method or new problem with old
method
- other problems that are very similar but not identical can be good sources
- another definition form QMUL: presenting someone else's work as one's own 
irrespective of intention. Extensive quotations; close paraphrasing; coying 
from the work of another person, including another student or using the ideas 
of another person, without proper acknowledgement, also constitute plagiarism
- taking other peoples work and presenting it as your own
- you have to imagine what the reader will believe from what you have written
- __plagiarism is a disciplinary offense__
- if more than 30% of the diploma is cited from an unknown source it is
considered plagiarism
- for math -- because it is so difficult to check -- there is a AMS website
that will check up whether or not something was plagiarized
- is it plagiarism if you submit a paper that contains already published
results even though those results were attained by you? probably yes
- you would certainly get 0 for your project and the possibility of expulsion
is definitely there
- transliteration is an effective way to fake out plagiarism detection software
- __our diploma project should at least contain one new idea from us__
- _bibtex_ and _cite_ for citing are recommended
- citing also adds value to your work because is shows that you did work etc
- citing too much is better than citing too little
- types of plagiarism
    - verbatim copying: `Ctrl + C`, `Ctrl + V`
- in math we don't generally argue from authority, even though some quotes
might be good for context
- when repeating arguments one should paraphrase which does not mean the same
sentences with slight changes -- read the argument, close the book, repeat it
in your own words
- if your argument is very similar to something that has been done before you
_must_ give attribution
- in math you could say something like "using the ideas of <name>'s proof" or
"following <name>" to express that you are orienting your work on someone
else's
- don't take images or videos without express permission and then you will
still have to cite them
- __create your own diagrams where ever possible__
- you could technically cite Wikipedia, but just don't. Cite a proper source.
- __choose supervisors now and not later__
