## Abstract

-abstract of the paper _Application of Additional Argument Method to Burgers
Type Equation with Integral Term_
- sentences are all very short
- no connection between sentences
- it contains all the important information
- no flow in the abstract
- maybe a bit too long? haven't checked

## Report

- presentation on report
    - _why_ did you do it (Motivation/Introduction)
    - _how_ did you do it (Method/Theory)
    - _what_ did you find (Results)
    - _what_ does it mean (Discussion)
- presentation principles (Aristotle)
    1. tell what you are going to say
    2. tell it
    3. tell what you said
- a good talk is about __one main idea__
- for a 10 minute report somewhere around 20 slides are good
- title slide, intro slides, Q&A slide as well
- $\leq$ 7 lines per slide
- don't have too much text and do not read from you slides
- voice and body language
    - don't fold your arms
    - look at your audience
    - be enthusiastic
    - move a bit on the stage
    - make eye contact
- tell a story but do not make it a riddle, tell the audience where you will
end up and how you will get there
- use appropriate jargon that your audience can understand
- make the presentation a mix of technical and non-technical jargon
- try to keep it as simple as possible
- practice giving talks before -- practice leads to a sigmoid improvement curve
- optimize time and don't go too slow but also not to fast
- allow questions (or not), but tell people
- include something visual in every slide
- __DON'T END LATE__
