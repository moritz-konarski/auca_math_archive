LECTURE 01	17.01.2019	INTERPOLATION

starting at with simpler funtions and building on top of that
we have two values for temperature and no function to get it. I exists though. Thus we use linear interpolation of some functions. 
This leads to a rough approximation of the real function which we may not be able to know or find. This can help us solve some difficult problems.
	SLIDES INTERPOLATION.PDF
see the main problem of interpolation from the slide.
We are looking for a continous function on the interval of a, b such that the mash funtion is is equal on that interval of the function.
the interval of f(x) may be part of the real numbers
we have to use the finite number of points xi in the domain of the function
f is element of the complex interval [a, b], with C to the power of the number of elements of the function, denoted by k 
	Two kinds of funtions:
Polynomial Interpolation (degree up to n-1 for n elements) of the class P subscript (n - 1) 
Spline Interpolation 
	EXAMPLE
Here we have a problem of Omega sub n (x) element of the set Pn
we will solve is as part of class Pn-1
is looks kind of like a inverted cosine
xi are the zeroes of the function and it is the main polynomial of our interpolation
now we construct a lagrangian polynomial
we start with the main polynomial and construct basic polynomials by using the fucting he is giving us in the slides
we can then prove that (omega n) / (basic funtions) = Product(basic functions) which is element of Pn-1
