LECTURE02 22.01.19 INTERPOLATION
let us suppose that we have points on [a..b] the mesh of the interpolation
then we have a mesh function called f(x). We ought to find it such that the values of f are equal
to the points of the functions
there can be many solutions of this function
in the space of all problems, we can find a unique solution
we should restrict it and we will only look at polynomials with degree n-1
we will start with the space of algebraic functions

special construction, the result is the lagrangian polynomial, it is omega sub n
it the linear affectence, where x sub i are the meeting points of the interpolation mesh
then we will construct the basis function, w sub n,k with the property: for arbitrary and fixed number k k=1..n
it is zero on every greet point except xk
the basis function is defined by a function with a fraction, we should prove the identity from slide1
He thinks the factions is too difficult because there is a derivative in the denominator
then we can use the product function instead because it is easier
proof: see the handwritten notes page 1
for j=k w=1; j!=k w=0;
the first function on slide2 is the lagrangian function

doing the proof we first prove that the polynomials the degree of n-1
read up on the properties and proofs of the lagrangian polynomial
let us prove by contradiction by supposing that we have another polynomial that is a solution of 
our problem. this would mean that our solution is not unique, which is what we want to prove.
q(x) has the form alpha0 + alpha1x + alpha2x^2 + alphan-1x^n-1
we will get the system of statements on slide4 
we get a homogenuous system of linear equations and the determinants are not zero, the system only has the solution 0
this is Kramer's rule to find the solution
the determinant of the system is not zero thus we have only a specific solution to the whole thing 
we get the 0-solution of the polynomial thus we know that it is a unique solution of the problem
the determinant of the system is the following: a huge matrix that has a determinant of not 0
it is called the Vandermonde matrix and we ought to prove it for next class
this matrix is pretty cool looking, in case we can't do it ourselves, there are solutions on the internet
--> This proves that in the space of n-1 we can find a unique solution for the equations

for simple examples see slide5, there we have different numbers of n and thus different polynomials
draw the graphs with R or python and add them to the document to make it a good exercise in rmarkdown
we can easily find the result for these graphs if we use the appropriate functions that are given to us
We, unsurprisingly, get polynomials of degree n-1, so it seems that our formulas work

Estimating the Error
if our function is smooth enough, we can estimate the function
smoothness: all continuous derivatives for all we have, the space of the complex numbers ^0 in [a..b]
superscript stands for the number of continuous derivatives that the functions have; see slide6

mesh function is the projection of the grid points as a projection onto the grid points, projections can be found on slide6
we will use this mesh function and construct the lagrangian polynomial to get the function
then we consider the error of interpolation of function f(x) and the interpolation polynomial
we would like to estimate the error. at greet points the value of the error is 0, because both functions intersect
then it is interesting to find the error at arbitrary x that is not a greet point. see diagram on slide6

we consider a special representation of this function, a supporting function gx(y) is equal to the equation on the bottom of slide6
omegan is the main function
properties of gx:
-the function is smooth enough, it has the same number of derivatives as the initial function
	consider the second (left) term. how many derivatives resp:y does the second term have?
	it has exactly n+1 derivatives because a polynomial of degree n has n+1 derivatives
-the initial function only has n derivatives, while our condtructed function has infinitely many derivatives
-the value of the supporting function at a greet-point is equal to 0, because at those the funtios intersect
	thus it is 0
-at point x the function is also 0, if we put it into the equation, it cancels out
