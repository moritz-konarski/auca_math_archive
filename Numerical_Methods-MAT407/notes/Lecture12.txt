FOR THE LAST PROJECT
  Runge-Kutta Methods: 25.04.19 is deadline
  Problems
  M: -> two different methods for runge kutta methods
  In the docs you can find three descriptions of the runge kutta methods
  one, two or three steps for the different methods
  we can start right now and get going, we will talk about the actual workings later
  We are given the problem and the analytic solution for each of the problem
  we draw the graph of the calculated and approximated solutions and compare them
  we also calculate the error between the two versions

WE ARE NOW DOING THE ANALYTIC SOLUTION OF PROBLEM 13 OF THE GIVEN PROBLEMS
