TODAYS TOPIC: Iteration Methods

we can have equations that would be hard to solve analytically, so we use iterating methods

we have the function f(x) = x^2 - 2 = 0;

we want to prove that lim_k -> inf (x_k) = x_* != 0
the proof is as follows:
    we take the limits of both sides of our iteration formula
        x_k+1 = 0.5(x_k + 2 / x_k); k = 0, 1, 2 ...
        x_0 is known
    we can simplify the equation once we take both sides
    finally we get (x_*)^2 = 2, which we could also have gotten through analysis
    we can also give a proof of more logical nature, I will try to take a picture of it

otherwise he is doing a whole host of proofs of some limit stuff, mainly in russian
we shall prove some shit for next class as well as do some work on our program, such that it will 
draw the graphs of the solutions to the problems
