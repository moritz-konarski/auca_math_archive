LECTURE ON PROJECT 3 OF THIS SEMESTER

we will not solve these equations analytically, as it is not the object of this course
we will apply numerical methods in order to solve these equations

FIRST ORDER

1. Simple Model - Population Model
  Any kind of growth that can be described using differential equations
  Radioactive decay, etc.
  d(P)/d(t) = k * P
  there is also the logistic model, read the material to remind yourself

2. Simple Model - Temperature Variation
  d(T)/d(t) = -k(T-A)
  this is useful for some things, just look at your notes from the diff equ. course
  this will help tremendously
  generally used for temperature change in e.g. a building or something like that

3. Simple Model - Tank with hole
  
SECOND ORDER

1. Second Newton's Law
  d^2(x)/d(t^2) = F(t) for the movement of some particle, we can also get a problem with
  boundary conditions to make them even harder

General Form: d(u)/d(t) = f(t, u(t)), t element (0, T]
              u(0) = phi

For the first type of solution we take the integral using the method of indeterminate
coefficients to make stupid fractions easier
we have to find the solution for P(t) to get the answer, this shit was really hard
