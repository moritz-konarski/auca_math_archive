TODAY WE WILL DO:  RUNGE-KUTTA-METHOD
Last meeting we discussed Euler's Method, we simply integrate out initial diff equ from t_n to t_n+1
we used the simplest rectangular formula to compute the function

Now we are doing the same thing with the trapezoidal rule instead of the normal rectangular rule.
We now have u(t_n+1) that also depends on itself because of the trapezoidal rule.
This is the implicit Runge-Kutta-Method, not the explicit one.
We shall only use the explicit method, but we have now seen that there are alternatives.

How can we make this more accurate?
    we do some things that I missed as I was not paying any attention
    we use the formulas on p. 3 in the Runge-Kutta presentation
    this one is in the course folder
    we use the group of formulas to try and understand where our know state takes us in the next step
    if we have and asymptotical statement, we have approximation according to some formula
    the error of the approximation has the order p according to the formula
    this thing converges with order p if we have the formula
    the inequality is the main one we need for all kinds of computations
    theorem nr. 1 can give us not only the convergence, but also the error of this thing.
    Let us assume that something is going on, just read about it later.
    We get some supporting results that help us with the approximation of the error
    we use the tales-formula of tau which will consider the derivative of degree p+1
    the sum of this is equal to 0 according to our assumption
    then we can find tau^(p+1) which is useful somehow?
    -> TODO: CHECK OUT THIS SHIT FOR THE FINAL EXAM. IT WILL BE USED there
            WRITE A SUMMARY IN .RMD FOR THIS SHIT AS WELL AS ALL OTHER COURSES THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN SO FAR
