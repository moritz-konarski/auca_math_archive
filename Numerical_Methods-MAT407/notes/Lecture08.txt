CONTINUATION OF TOPIC FROM LAST LECTURE: NUMERICAL INTEGRATION

we created a family of the rectangular rules, for some value = 1/2
  then we get the highest accuracy

Simple Formula
  instead of f(x) we will consider the lagrangian polynomial with degree one, we take two
  points as boundary points -> we get the lagrangian polynomial that is a straight line
  going through a and b
  We then calculate the area of the resulting trapezoidal area -> this is the definite
  integral that we want to achieve
  We can estimate the error using chebyshev's norm for the inequality

Composite Trapezoidal Rule
  We use the mesh on the interval a, b
  I think we just sum up a couple of simple trapezoidal areas -> composite trapezoidal
  rule
