GAUSSIAN METHOD OF SOLVING SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS

This is a prerequisite to use Thomas' algorithm to then solve the system.
Gaussian method is traditionally used in computation, not Kramer's Rule
Reason: the determinant in Cramer's rule is required to find a valid, unique solution
  the same is also true for Gaussian Elimination. 
Gaussian Method has n^3 computational complexity
Cramer's rule has n! computational complexity
This obviously favors the Gaussian Method -> faster to compute and more accurate

Gaussian Method
  How this method works algorithmically; just look it up on the internet

Minor of a matrix: all of the minors should not be zero to enable Gaussian approach

Selection of the major element: 

Tridiagonal matrix: See (4) from presentation Systems of linear algebra.pdf

All but the main diagonal two rows are zeros, making it easy to calculate stuff in it

We have now the general approach that we used for the cubic splines, just in a more
specific version of it

This is for ODE of second order, we can try to use the method of finite differences
it is done by constructing difference schemes, which has the same form that the 
tridiagonal system has

figure out how to use thomas algorithm

use this for the excercises that we do not even have to do yet.
