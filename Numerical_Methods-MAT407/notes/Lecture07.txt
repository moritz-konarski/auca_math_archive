NUMERICAL INTEGRATION - Numerical Integration.pdf
  this will include: definite integrals

We will use a sum to estimate definite integrals Sum(c_i * f(x_i), i=1, n)
This thing is called "quadruce formula?"
For the error we calculate the difference between the integral and the sum
its denoted delta[f]

There are rectangular, trapeziodal and sinodal rules of this formula

RECTANGULAR RULE
  instead of f(x) we consider the constant c for the whole interval
    we use (b-a)f(x) as the value
  the sum of the rectangular thing is really variable, as it changes drastically based on
  your selection of x
  So there are some ways to choose some good points:
  x(theta) = theta*b + (1-theta)*a; theta element [0, 1]
  we use Taylor's Formula, the remainder of it, to make it nice and pretty
  we then take the integral of both sides of the equation and then we get
  out integral on one side and get the result for our equation
  
  Then we strive to estimate the error of the function
  we take the family of rectangular rules and then we get slide4 of the presentation in
  lab2 
  we get some more complicated error formulas and shit, so it is really good
