we try to devide the number line into two sections

we assume a > 0
one where the function is greater 0 and one where it is not.
We draw this like we draw the slope of a function when investigating it

we suppose that x_k+1 >= one of its roots (sqrt(2)), does it then mean that
x_k >= as well?
this is the question we have to answer. I will try to do this for the next class to get some extra points



we try to find the square root of minus 2 if I got that correctly
which is pretty much impossible because it is not >= 0

we draw the same kind of graphics that we use to display the slope of a graph
when investigating functions and
