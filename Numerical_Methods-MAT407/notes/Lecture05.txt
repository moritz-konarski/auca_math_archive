SPLINE INTERPOLATION  07.02.2019

This spline depends on the greet selection and the interval.

Spline is the function of x with the following properties:
  for each arbitrary interval it is the function of degree n
  the function is smooth enough
  the function has at least n-1 continuous derivatives in each interval
  see slide 14
  the spline is the solution of the main interpolating problem
  -> these are the three properties that you should know

Spline of degree 1 (slide 15):
  n=1
  it is the polynomial of degree 1 in each interval (it is a straight line) from point to
    point
  the function should be continuous
  there is a formula for the spline on the slide for n=1
  from this formula we can construct a piecewise interpolation function

  Error: slide 16
  to estimate the left part, we must first estimate the right part
  we consider the maximum value of the second derivative on the interval [a, b]
  we use the absolute value for some reason
  we calculate the abs(max(f)) for the function
  we take the point of the max point and put it into the formula
  then we get some simpler terms
  h is the maximum value of each interval
  then we get the error estimation for the right part
  the right part now does not depend on i, so not on one specific point
  we estimate the right part and then get the answer
  we can now consider h to tend towards zero, then both limits go to zero
  order of convergence of the interpolation (spline of the first order) is 2
  
Quadratic spline is skipped because it is in the lab and it is easy?

Cubic Spline, n=3 (slide 18):
  n=3, on each node interval it is a polynomial of degree three
  on the interval [a, b], it has at least n-1 (2) derivatives
  this spline is also a solution of the main interpolation problem

  Algorithm:
  on each mesh interval the 2nd derivate will be a polynomial is of degree one (first
    order)
  if we know this polynomial and have the mesh points, then we can construct the function
  we don't know them, but they exist because we stated that its derivatives are
    continuous on the interval [a, b]
  interval M_i, (i from 1 to n)
  then we can create the formula for this second derivate using the formula (of straight
    line) in slide 18
  x is in the interval [x_i, x_i+1]
  to get the original function, we take the integral of this function twice, to arrive at
    f(x)
  but then we get some unknown values as constants of integration (see equation (8))
  these constants depend on i, because they are different for each interval
  if we had all the variables, we could find the values of x in the interval
  to calculate them we use the properties of the cubic spline
  S_3 is continuous and that is corresponds to the values of the mesh points on both ends
    (as it is designed to do)
  substitute x for x_i and x_i+1, we get the formulas in (9)
  we consider this a system with respect to c_1 and c_2
  the determinant of this system is not zero, so there is a unique solution, then we
    substitute the c's into (8)
  formula (10) is for the first derivative, (11) for the zeroth
  taking it a step further and also find the formula for the original function
  spline parameters:
  we have not considered the continuity
  we consider the limit of the function from the right and from the left
  let's suppose that we have an interior mesh point in the middle of our two points
  this gives us two sub-intervals, we now take the limit from both sides using two
    different functions using (12) for the left limit and (13) for the right side
  because the point must be part of the formulas, we can set both limits equal to each
    other
  after some transformation we get formula (15)
  we now gave a function that gets us the formula
  we have n-2 interior greet points, we have formula (15) for each of them
  these formulas can be considered to be systems of linear equations
  we have n unknown parameters (n points) but only n-2 formulas

  thus we have to add two equations to this system to be able to solve it 
  so let's suppose we have two functions with two continuous derivatives
  we also know the values of the functions at a and b (the ends of the interval)
  on slide 21 we can find the equations
  now we have as many unknown values as we have equations, we can solve this system
  we can use the Gauss method to solve this problem
  we may also use the Thomas algorithm to solve the system
  
  if we do not know the second derivatives of the system, we might choose to use the
    zeros of the functions to add two equations to the system
  this is called the normal spline, it is the simplest form, but not easy

  the last possibility is that we know the values of the first derivate at the boundary
    points, so we can do that because we have the points as we know the functions

  ==> YOU HAVE TO USE AT LEAST TWO FORMS OF CLOSURE

  for this we have the first derivates of the splines and then use them on the
    subinterval where we use (12) and (13)
  we then get two other equations where i=0 and i=n, both near a or b
  we arrive at (18) so that we can add the values to the system to make it solvable
  -this is the most difficult approach, but Thomas algorithm can do it just fine

SOLUTION:
  how do we now use this to find the spline?
   for the beginning we solve system (15) with the given parameters using Thomas'
    algorithm
  then we need to calculate the sub-interval that x belongs to (it's easier if the mesh
    is uniform)

Error:
  the proof is pretty difficult
  error is on slide 22
  in the case of a uniform mesh you can use the equation
  you always get h to the power of n+1
  this also means that the higher order spline you use, the better the approximation gets
