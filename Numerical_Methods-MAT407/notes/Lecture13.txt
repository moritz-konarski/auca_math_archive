Today we will hear presentations on the last lab.

First is Aidai, she has rectangles with theta = 1 and trapezoidal rule
  she had some minor problems 'with her code' so it did not work like she intended
  but overall it worked fine to compute the things he wanted to see
  she concluded that trapezoidal rule is the most accurate out of the ones she has
  tested
Second is Ilya, he has rectangles with theta = 0 and simpson's rule
  his program works, he explained his methods first and then showed his program in action
  this is pretty good. This worked pretty well.

RUNGE KUTTA METHOD 
  we shall rewrite some problem in the standard form for these types of equations
  we must put it into the form found on page 7 of the presentation as f(t, u(t)), t element (0, T]
  only after we put it into this form we can use the Runge Kutta Method.
  this will need to be done for each of the test problems
  we must satisfy the Lipschitz Condition that we have taked about in the ODE course, still got no idea
  then we will simply cycle through all the values that our equation can take, basically approximating it
  this thing gives an approximation of course. It is not a direct, fully correct solution
  we have a recurrence relation that allows us to calculate all the values, starting from the initial value
  that we are given. This is called the RK one stage/one step method. It may also called the Euler's Method.
  It is the simplest version of this method, it will be pretty inaccurate of course, as these things go.
  If it is really simple, it's probably false/has a large error.
