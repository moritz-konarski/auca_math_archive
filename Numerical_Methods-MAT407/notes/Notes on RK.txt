just write the function that is given as a test problem as
f(t, u(t)) and then apply the iterative Euler's method to that 
specific equation to see if it works as one would expect
this might shed light on how the method works
if it were just that simple to do that, I would be happy
also, write a summary of the topic, or at least begin to
do that
