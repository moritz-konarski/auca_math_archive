# VANDERMONDE MATRIX
For Vandermonde Matrix see Wikipedia
it shows a geometric progression in each row
V(i,j) = a^j-1 sub i
the determinant is the product of the difference of some values alpha
if all the numbers are distince, it is never zero
the Vandermonde matrix evaluates a polynomial at a set of points
its the matrix of the linear map that maps the vector of coefficients of a polynomial 
in case there are only distinct points in the matrix, it shows that the mapping of 
coefficients to the values at the points is a one-to-one correspondence, thus the
interpolation problem can have a unique solution -> unisolvence theorem

# UNISOLVENCE THEOREM
states that there is a unique polynomial and it can be proven by the vandermonde matrix

# LECTURE
this is my problem, there is an english version somewhere, do the project and write
a short report on it.
only use formulas 2 and three for lab one, there are all the descriptions that you might
ONLY USE FORMULAS 2 AND 3, NOT THE OTHERS
need
At the end threre are formulas for the meshes that we will use
after that there are the functions that we will have to use in the project
everyone has number 14, where we have to create our own function that we shall prepare

for the quadratic one's you will find the description of all the formulas in the second
lab use the epsilon formula with ^-k that is given there. choose points by 1+2^k
people will compare two graphics and then also estimate the error with a special
greet/mesh
greet points will be really cool because we use special points, woohooo-
fulfill all the requirements and then write a good report about it in rmarkdown

can you implement C# in rmarkdown? -that would be really nice 

there is the definition of the cubic spline here, which we will talk about, but we should
start on our own
you will find the formulas there and you ought to use different boundary value problems
to get some more interesting results

there is an example program in the electronic website textbook to see were there are 
use a drop down menu to offer 1+2^k to compute them, epsilon is 2^-k
this ought to make it easy to use. the program will be of great help 

We are supposed to use the form that he offers us in the file because it is easy to get
started
it will help us to get somewhere
it was especially created for lagrange polynomials, change it to make it better

again, drop down menu for the number of greet points, but make it more the
we should change it to the power of two things and then make the choices larger

make everything a drop down list to make it as simple as possible for the user.
use latex as a way to draw the formulas? can you do that?
add some output to display the error of the calculation to complete the program

Visual Studio is pretty simple and we should be able to make it work

to draw the functions, we are supposed to use ZedGraph, a program that is included and we
should modify it to make it look better

--  In short, use the template and then fit it to the requirements 
--  The report should be only one to two pages long, so nothing really thorough
--  additionally, calculate the value of the error, make a special procedure
