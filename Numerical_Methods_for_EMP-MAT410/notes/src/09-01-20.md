## In-Class Notes

### General Organization

- discussion of classes to take
- we will take two electives in spring and not this semester
- _Mathematical Models in Economics_ and _Mathematical Models in Geophysics_
in spring

### Introduction

- we took _Equations of Mathematical Physics_
- our resources are: _Google Classroom_, _Google Drive_
- we will use _Visual Studio_ with _C#_ and _Zed Graph_ to write our programs

### Grading

- 3 different projects totaling 80 point
    1. different methods for solving advection-diffusion transport problems
    2. different methods to solve heat equation
    3. methods to solve elliptic equation through iteration
- __see syllabus__
- final exam is 20 point

### Evolutionary Advection-Diffusion Equation

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \cdot \left(\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+ \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial z^2} \right) + a_1 \cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + a_2 \cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + a_3 \cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} - b \cdot u$$

- this could be simplified to

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \cdot \nabla^2 u + \vec a \nabla u- b \cdot 
u$$

- if we take the one-dimensional form of this equation, convection and advection
are the same
- we get a stationary equation that is simple because it is one-dimensional and
does not depend on time
- we have several forms that are called different names -- three types of
boundary problems
- we can re-write the equation in operator form
- thus we can define $F(x)$ in operator form -- this will make is simpler
- theoretical results show that unique solutions belong to a class of functions
that have continuous derivatives
- problem number 1 has one classic equation
- we will consider different approaches to solving this problem

#### Approximation of Derivatives

- see _Theorem 1_ and $(4)$ and $(5)$
- we will consider a uniform mesh with a step
- it has $n$ greet points
- we'll consider an approximation of derivatives on this grid
- we will use _Taylor's formula_ iteratively in $(4)$
- last point is remainder where we consider the unknown point $\theta$
- in the future we will suppose that our solution is smooth enough -- there are
at least 4 continuous derivatives
- we denote the order of the remainder with respect to $h$ meaning it tends to
$0$ if $h$ tends to $0$
- look at other slides to look at what slides and symbols we are using
- _approximation for the first derivative by forward difference_
- we can also obtain a backward difference and a central difference

## After Class Notes

### Syllabus

- classical and modern numerical methods for partial differential equations
- we'll consider boundary-value and initial-boundary-value problems
- topics:
    1. advection-diffusion
    2. poisson equations
    3. non-stationary heat equations
- 100 points in total, 80 points for 3 lab projects, 20 points for final exam

### Advection-Diffusion Equation

- a combination of the diffusion (advection) and convection equations
- describes physical systems where these two things are happening
- the general equation is
$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \left( D \nabla c \right) - 
\nabla \cdot \left( \vec v c \right) + R $$
- $c$ is the variable we want to study (could be x)
- $D$ is the diffusivity, it describes how quickly two things diffuse into each 
  other
- $\vec v$ is the velocity field that stuff is moving through -- it describes 
  time and space
- $R$ describes sources or sinks of material -- whether or not material 
  increases or decreases
- $\nabla$ is the gradient -- a vector of partial derivatives of the function by 
  each of the variables
- $\nabla \cdot$ is the divergence -- whether or not material moves away from a 
  point or not

#### Common Simplification

$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 c - \vec v \cdot \nabla c$$

- often no sources or sinks are assumed
- if the flow is incompressible, the divergence is 0
- the diffusion coefficient is assumed constant

#### Equation From Class

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \cdot \nabla^2 u + \vec a \nabla u- b \cdot 
u$$

- $k$ is the diffusivity
- $u$ is the variable in question
- $\vec a$ is the velocity field
- $-b \cdot u$ is a negative sink in the process
