\subsection{Sinking Funds}

\begin{itemize}
    \item you pay interest each month but nothing more
    \item at the end you simply pay the full loan amount back
    \item generally you invest the money into a \textbf{sinking fund} in the
        meantime -- if you get a higher interest rate than you pay, you could
        even make money
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Yield Rates}

\begin{itemize}
    \item only the payments made directly by or to the person(s) should be
        considered for that person(s)'s yield rate
    \item simply solve the problem you are given using a calculator
\end{itemize}
